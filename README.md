# Arduino-Parallel-analogRead
An Arduino library for non-blocking analogRead.

I'm not familiar with the ADC of the Arduino-Microcontroller, so most of the code is copied. I'm not sure what source I had when I made it, but I'm pretty sure it was this one: https://www.arduinoslovakia.eu/blog/2018/9/a/d-prevodnik---meranie-bez-blokovania?lang=en
